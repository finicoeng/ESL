#Making Verbal Mistakes

Omar: Ha ha. 

Faith: What’s so funny? 

Omar: I’m editing Paul’s speech so that it can be posted on our website, but I didn’t realize how many **verbal** mistakes he made. 

Faith: Were there a lot? 

Omar: Yeah, he **mispronounced** the last name of the manager in charge of new products, for one. He also **stumbled over** the name of the new products. 

Faith: I did notice that he had a few problems with **delivery**. 

Omar: That’s **putting it lightly**. He **stuttered** when trying to list the products’ features. It’s true that some of the **verbiage** was written like **tongue twisters**, but I thought he would have **had it down cold** by now. 

Faith: I noticed he made a few **slips of the tongue**, but I didn’t notice all that. I guess I wasn’t listening too closely. But what were you laughing about when I walked in? 

Omar: Paul made a **Freudian slip**. Instead of saying that “innovation is **our bread and butter**,” he said that it was our “bed and butter.” Maybe that’s why he had so many **flubs**. His mind was elsewhere. 

Faith: I think you’ll have plenty of material for a **blooper reel**. 

Omar: That’s true. In fact, if this were a film, I’d have more **outtakes** than usable **footage**!
