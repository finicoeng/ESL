# 1159 - Describing the Fit of Clothing

Vera: How do these pants look on me?

Wang: Uh, aren't they a little too **tight**? They look like they're **cutting off circulation** in your legs.

Vera: They're little **snug**, but they **show off my curves**, don't they?

Wang: I suggest **going up a size**. Something a little less **form fitting** would be a lot more comfortable.

Vera: I'm not **going for** comfort. I'm going for style.

Wang: Here, try these pants. They're **looser** and offer more **room**.

Vera: These don't show my shape at all. They're not **in the least flattering**.

Wang: But you can move in them without **busting a seam**.

Vera: You're missing the point. I want look good in these pants **no matter what**.

Wang: **Spoken like** a true **slave to fashion**!
