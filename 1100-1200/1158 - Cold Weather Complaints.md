# 1158 - Cold Weather Complaints

Boris: Come on, keep climbing! This is the best exercise you'll get all winter.

Kay: My face hurts and I can't stop **shivering**.

Boris: If we **pick up the pace**, you'll warm up.

Kay: I doubt it. I can feel my **core body temperature dipping**. I feel **hypothermia** coming on.

Boris: Don't be silly. You're **dressed in layers**, with fabric that **wicks moisture** away from your skin and **insulates** your body from the cold. The worst you're going to get are **dry skin** and **cracked lips**.

Kay: Then why do I feel **pins and needles** in my hands and **numbness** in my feet?

Boris: Maybe you're just getting used to the cold. You'll feel warmer in a minute.

Kay: But what if they're signs of **frostbite**? I think I'll turn back before I **freeze**.

Boris: And miss out on these **awe-inspiring** winter views?

Kay: I prefer the awe-inspiring views of a **blazing** fire!
