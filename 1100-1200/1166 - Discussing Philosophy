# 1166 - Discussing Philosophy

Rene: Why are you sitting here just **starting into space**?

> 

Francis: I'm **pondering** life.

> 

Rene: That sounds **profound**.

> 

Francis: I'm examining my life from a **metaphysical standpoint**. I'm not sure I really **exist**. Maybe my entire life is an **illusion** and there's no such thing as **reality**.

> 

Rene: Okay. Are you sure you're feeling all right?

> 

Francis: I'm better now that I've made some decisions about my **epistemological outlook** on life. I'm allowing **reason** and **logic** to guide me.

> 

Rene: That's great, but you still seem a little **distracted**.

> 

Francis: That's because I'm **wrestling** with some major questions about
**ethics** and **morality**. It's not easy always trying to do the right thing.

> 

Rene: I can undestand that, but could you get me...?

> 

Francis: But then I think that perhaps the only thing that matters in life are **esthetics**, and I should devote my life to creating beauty.

> 

Rene: That's a nice idea, but have you given any thought to how you'd pay the rent? You could start by getting me a cup of coffee.

> 

Francis: Ah, I see you're a **realist**. Do you want your usual or do you want to hear the specials?
